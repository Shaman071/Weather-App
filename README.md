# Weather-App


🌦 Weather App – Project Description

The Weather App is a simple yet powerful web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city in the world. The app fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a clean and user-friendly interface.

✨ Key Features:

City Search – Users can enter the name of any city to get weather details.

Real-Time Data – Fetches live weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions) using API integration.

Responsive Design – Built with CSS to ensure the app works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Dynamic UI – JavaScript dynamically updates the weather details without reloading the page.

Error Handling – Alerts the user if an invalid city name is entered.

🛠 Technologies Used:

HTML → Structure of the application (input box, button, weather info display).

CSS → Styling and responsiveness, making the UI visually appealing.

JavaScript → Fetch API to get data from OpenWeatherMap, update DOM dynamically, and handle user interactions.

🌍 Real-World Use Case:
This app can be used as a lightweight weather-checking tool by travelers, students, or anyone who needs quick access to weather updates. It also demonstrates practical use of API integration and frontend development skills.
